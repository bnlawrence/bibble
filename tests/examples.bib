  abstract = {A climate model represents a multitude of processes on a variety of timescales and space scales: a canonical example of multi-physics multi-scale modeling. The underlying climate system is physically characterized by sensitive dependence on initial conditions, and natural stochastic variability, so very long integrations are needed to extract signals of climate change. Algorithms generally possess weak scaling and can be I/O and/or memory-bound. Such weak-scaling, I/O, and memory-bound multi-physics codes present particular challenges to computational performance.  Traditional metrics of computational efficiency such as performance counters and scaling curves do not tell us enough about real sustained performance from climate models on different machines. They also do not provide a satisfactory basis for comparative information across models. codes present particular challenges to computational performance.  We introduce a set of metrics that can be used for the study of computational performance of climate (and Earth system) models. These measures do not require specialized software or specific hardware counters, and should be accessible to anyone. They are independent of platform and underlying parallel programming models. We show how these metrics can be used to measure actually attained performance of Earth system models on different machines, and identify the most fruitful areas of research and development for performance engineering. codes present particular challenges to computational performance.  We present results for these measures for a diverse suite of models from several modeling centers, and propose to use these measures as a basis for a CPMIP, a computational performance model intercomparison project (MIP).},

  abstract = {A series of experiments are described that examine the sensitivity of the northern-hemisphere winter evolution to the equatorial quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO). The prime tool for the experiments is a stratosphere-mesosphere model. The model is integrated over many years with the modelled equatorial winds relaxed towards observed values in order to simulate a realistic QBO. In experiment A the equatorial winds are relaxed towards Singapore radiosonde observations in the height region 16-32 km. In contrast to previous modelling studies, the Holton-Tan relationship (warm/cold winters associated with easterly/westerly QBO winds in the lower stratosphere) is absent. However, in a second experiment (run B) in which the equatorial winds are relaxed towards rocketsonde data over the extended height range 16-58 km, a realistic Holton-Tan relationship is reproduced. A series of further studies are described that explore in more detail the sensitivity to various equatorial height regions and to the bottom-boundary forcing. The experiments suggest that the evolution of the northern-hemisphere winter circulation is sensitive to equatorial winds throughout the whole depth of the stratosphere and not just to the lower-stratospheric wind direction as previously assumed.},

No longer is climate model output of sole interest to climate scientists and researchers in the climate change impacts and adaptation fields.

For this host of users, accurate and complete metadata (i.e., information about how and why the data were produced) is required to document the climate modeling results. Here we describe a pilot community initiative to collect and make available documentation of climate models and their simulations. In an initial application, a metadata repository is being established to provide information of this kind for a major internationally coordinated modeling activity known as CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, Phase 5). It is expected that for a wide range of stakeholders, this and similar community-managed metadata repositories will spur development of analysis tools that facilitate discovery and exploitation of Earth system simulations.},

  abstract = {Gravity waves are disturbances whose restoring force is buoyancy. In the atmosphere they are made possible by the variation of potential temperature with height. They can be excited by various mechanisms including flow over orography. The momentum carried by these disturbances can exert significant drag forces on the mean flow in the terrestrial mesosphere. One parameterization of this effect, the Lindzen gravity wave drag scheme, is inserted into two simplified general circulation models (GCMs) of the Martian atmosphere, and its effects are described. The influence of large-amplitude, planetary-scale topography on wave breaking altitudes is discussed. We show that above 60 km in altitude, gravity wave drag dominates the momentum balance of the Martian atmosphere on the largest scales. This indirectly alters the thermal state of the atmosphere through the thermal wind relation. Model winds at this level are consistent with other, simpler studies, as well as with Earth-based spectroscopic observations. Below 60 km, the effects of planetary wave-mean flow interaction, as well as heating associated with Hadley circulation descent, are significant in determining the wind strength. Eddy diffusion coefficients derived from the Lindzen parameterization above 50 km are consistent with values implied from chemical modeling of the Martian middle atmosphere, as well as with simpler models of gravity wave drag.},

  abstract = {Recent three dimensional simulations of the Martian atmosphere have shown that gravity wave drag is a large, and possibly dominant, term in the momentum balance above 50 km. In previous simulations, a constant value was used for the topographic variance on scales smaller than the model grid. Spatial variations in this quantity are now taken into account, and the results described. The topographic variance has its highest amplitude in the Tharsis and Hellas regions. Correspondingly, relatively low breaking levels are found here. Longitudinal variations in breaking levels and hence accelerations are very large, as are zonal asymmetries in zonal wind u. These asymmetries are expected to play a role in planetary wave propagation in the Martian middle atmosphere. Momentum balances are found to be dependent on nonlinear coupling terms in the momentum equations due to the high zonal winds and small planetary radius. At the equinoxes two regimes exist. One is where breaking levels are very low: here accelerations and eddy diffusion coefficients resulting from the parameterization of gravity wave breaking in the model are also very low. The other regime is where breaking levels are higher, and winds are stronger. In this region, vertical mixing is also very weak. These results give further credence to the idea that breaking thermal tides cause the intense vertical diffusion that has been inferred from observations at the Martian equinox.},

Information is transferred from observations to unobserved variables in two ways: through the temporal evolution of the predictive equations (either a forecast model or its adjoint) or through an error covariance matrix (or a parametrized approximation to the error covariance). Here, it is found that high frequency information tends to flow through the former route, low frequency through the latter. It is also noted that using the Kalman Filter analysis to estimate the correlation between the observed and unobserved variables can lead to a biased result because of an error correlation: this error correlation is absent when the Kalman Smoother is used.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} The data request of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) defines all the quantities from CMIP6 simulations that should be archived. This includes both quantities of general interest needed from most of the CMIP6-endorsed model intercomparison projects (MIPs) and quantities that are more specialized and only of interest to a single endorsed MIP. The complexity of the data request has increased from the early days of model intercomparisons, as has the data volume. In contrast with CMIP5, CMIP6 requires distinct sets of highly tailored variables to be saved from each of the more than 200 experiments. This places new demands on the data request information base and leads to a new requirement for development of software that facilitates automated interrogation of the request and retrieval of its technical specifications. The building blocks and structure of the CMIP6 Data Request (DREQ), which have been constructed to meet these challenges, are described in this paper.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Thus far JASMIN has been used primarily by the atmospheric science and earth observation communities, both to support their direct scientific workflow, and the curation of data products in the STFC Centre for Environmental Data Archival (CEDA). Initial JASMIN configuration and first experiences are reported here. Useful improvements in scientific workflow are presented. It is clear from the explosive growth in stored data and use that there was a pent up demand for a suitable big-data analysis environment. This demand is not yet satisfied, in part because JASMIN does not yet have enough compute, the storage is fully allocated, and not all software needs are met. Plans to address these constraints are introduced.},

  abstract = {The UPSCALE (UK on PRACE: weather-resolving Simulations of Climate for globAL Environmental risk) project constructed and ran an ensemble of HadGEM3 (Hadley Centre Global Environment Model 3) atmosphere-only global climate simulations over the period 1985–2011, at resolutions of N512 (25 km), N216 (60 km) and N96 (130 km) as used in current global weather forecasting, seasonal prediction and climate modelling respectively.  Alongside these present climate simulations a parallel ensemble looking at extremes of future climate was run, using a time-slice methodology to consider conditions at the end of this century.
 These simulations were primarily performed using a 144 million core hour, single year grant of computing time from PRACE (the Partnership for Advanced Computing in Europe) in 2012, with additional resources supplied by the Natural Environment  Research Council (NERC) and the Met Office.  Almost 400 terabytes of simulation data were generated on the HERMIT supercomputer at the High Performance Computing Center Stuttgart (HLRS), and transferred to the JASMIN super-data cluster provided by the Science and Technology Facilities Council Centre for Data Archival (STFC CEDA) for analysis and storage.
 In this paper we describe the implementation of the project, present the technical challenges in terms of optimisation, data output, transfer and storage that such a project involves and include details of the model configuration and the composition of the UPSCALE data set.  This data set is available for scientific analysis to allow assessment of the value of model resolution in both present and potential future climate conditions.},

  abstract = {Performance modelling is a useful tool in the lifeycle of high performance scientific software, such as weather and climate models, especially as a means of ensuring efficient use of available computing resources. In particular, sufficiently accurate performance prediction could reduce the effort and experimental computer time required when porting and optimising a climate model to a new machine. Yet as architectures become more complex, performance prediction is becoming more difficult. Traditional methods of performance prediction, based on source code analysis and supported by machine benchmarks, are proving inadequate to the task. In this paper, the reasons for this are explored by applying some traditional techniques to predict the computation time of a simple shallow water model which is illustrative of the computation (and communication) involved in climate models. These models are compared with real execution data gathered on AMD Opteron-based systems, including several phases of the U.K. academic community HPC resource, HECToR. Some success is had in relating source code to achieved performance for the K10 series of Opterons, but the method is found to be inadequate for the next-generation Interlagos processor. The experience leads to the investigation of a data-driven application benchmarking approach to performance modelling. Results for an early version of the approach are presented using the shallow model as an example. In addition, the data-driven approach is compared with a novel analytical model based on fitting logarithmic curves to benchmarked application data. The limitations of this analytical method provide further motivation for the development of the data-driven approach and results of this work have been published elsewhere.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Numerical simulation, and in particular simulation of the earth system, relies on contributions from diverse communities, from those who develop models to those involved in devising, executing, and analysing numerical experiments.
Often these people work in different institutions and may be working with significant separation in time (particularly analysts, who may be working on data produced years earlier), and they typically communicate via published information (whether journal papers, technical notes, or websites).
The complexity of the models, experiments, and methodologies, along with the diversity (and sometimes inexact nature) of information sources, can easily lead to misinterpretation of what was actually intended or done.
In this paper we introduce a taxonomy of terms for more clearly defining numerical experiments, put it in the context of previous work on experimental ontologies, and describe how we have used it to document the experiments of the sixth phase for the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6).
We describe how, through iteration with a range of CMIP6 stakeholders, we rationalized multiple sources of information and improved the clarity of experimental definitions.
We demonstrate how this process has added value to CMIP6 itself by (a)~helping those devising experiments to be clear about their goals and their implementation, (b)~making it easier for those executing experiments to know what is intended, (c)~exposing interrelationships between experiments, and (d)~making it clearer for third parties (data users) to understand the CMIP6 experiments.
We conclude with some lessons learnt and how these may be applied to future CMIP phases as well as other modelling campaigns.},

  abstract = {Twelve simulations of the stratosphere and mesosphere have been performed to investigate the near-major stratospheric warming of January 1992. All were initialized close to the observed warming. the resulting simulations fall into two classes: those that accurately reproduce the timing and anticyclonic merger mechanism of the observed warming and those that fail. the model used was a mechanistic stratosphere-mesosphere model. with a prescribed troposphere; thus differences among the simulations must only be due to differences among the initial conditions, which were constructed using different combinations of observed and climatological data. the main differences between the initial conditions of those simulations that succeed and those that fail are in low latitudes. A detailed analysis of two contrasting simulations reveals that the one which fails does not accurately reproduce the observed conveyor belt feeding tropical low-potential-vorticity (PV) air into the Aleutian high. Several factors appear to have combined to make the difference between the successful and the unsuccessful simulation of this sudden warming. the amount of low PV already present in higher latitudes in the initial condition appears to have an influence, as does the strength of the subtropical PV barrier. Also important is the Rossby wave structure which, by determining the degree of zonal asymmetry of the PV barrier, influences the injection of low PV into higher latitudes. In addition, however, we propose that the inertial stability of the tropical upper stratosphere might have played a significant role. In the unsuccessful simulation the tropical upper stratosphere is more inertially unstable than in the successful simulation; in this region more vigorous small-scale roll structures develop which, in stabilizing the flow, might have inhibited the northward transport of tropical air that appears to be a key part of the development of the observed sudden warming.},

  abstract = {The Along-Track Scanning Radiometers (ATSRs) provide a long time-series of measurements suitable for the retrieval of cloud properties. This work evaluates the freely-available Global Retrieval of ATSR Cloud Parameters and Evaluation (GRAPE) dataset (version 3) created from the ATSR-2 (1995–2003) and Advanced ATSR (AATSR; 2002 onwards) records. Users are recommended to consider only retrievals flagged as high-quality, where there is a good consistency between the measurements and the retrieved state (corresponding to about 60\% of converged retrievals over sea, and more than 80\% over land). Cloud properties are found to be generally free of any significant spurious trends relating to satellite zenith angle. Estimates of the random error on retrieved cloud properties are suggested to be generally appropriate for optically-thick clouds, and up to a factor of two too small for optically-thin cases. The correspondence between ATSR-2 and AATSR cloud properties is high, but a relative calibration difference between the sensors of order 5–10\% at 660 nm and 870 nm limits the potential of the current version of the dataset for trend analysis. As ATSR-2 is thought to have the better absolute calibration, the discussion focusses on this portion of the record. Cloud-top heights from GRAPE compare well to ground-based data at four sites, particularly for shallow clouds. Clouds forming in boundary-layer inversions are typically around 1 km too high in GRAPE due to poorly-resolved inversions in the modelled temperature profiles used. Global cloud fields are compared to satellite products derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) measurements, and a climatology of liquid water content derived from satellite microwave radiometers. In all cases the main reasons for differences are linked to differing sensitivity to, and treatment of, multi-layer cloud systems. The correlation coefficient between GRAPE and the two MODIS products considered is generally high (greater than 0.7 for most cloud properties), except for liquid and ice cloud effective radius, which also show biases between the datasets. For liquid clouds, part of the difference is linked to choice of wavelengths used in the retrieval. Total cloud cover is slightly lower in GRAPE (0.64) than the CALIOP dataset (0.66). GRAPE underestimates liquid cloud water path relative to microwave radiometers by up to 100 g m−2 near the Equator and overestimates by around 50 g m−2 in the storm tracks. Finally, potential future improvements to the algorithm are outlined.},

The GRAPE AOD over ocean is found to be in good agreement with AERONET measurements, with a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.79 and a best-fit slope of 1.0±0.1, but with a positive bias of 0.08±0.04. Although the GRAPE and GACP datasets show reasonable agreement, there are significant differences. These discrepancies are explored, and suggest that the downward trend in AOD reported by GACP may arise from changes in sampling due to the orbital drift of the AVHRR instruments.},

  abstract = {The Climate Science Modelling Language (CSML) has been developed by the NERC DataGrid (NDG) project as a standards-based data model and XML markup for describing and constructing climate science datasets. It uses conceptual models from emerging standards in GIS to define a number of feature types, and adopts schemas of the Geography Markup Language (GML) where possible for encoding.

 A prototype deployment of CSML is being trialled across the curated archives of the British Atmospheric and Oceanographic Data Centres. These data include a wide range of data types – both observational and model – and heterogeneous file-based storage systems.

 CSML provides a semantic abstraction layer for data files, and is exposed through higher level data delivery services. In NDG these will include file instantiation services (for formats of choice) and the web services of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC).Citation: Woolf,~A., Lawrence,~B., Lowry,~R., Kleese~van~Dam,~K., Cramer,~R., Gutierrez,~M., Kondapalli,~S., Latham,~S., Lowe,~D., O'Neill,~K., and Stephens,~A.: Data integration with the Climate Science Modelling Language, Adv.

  abstract = {Data services for the grid have focussed so far primarily on virtualising access to distributed databases, and encapsulating file location. However, orchestration of services requires richer information semantics than these mechanisms provide. Service inputs and outputs must be semantically matched, or characterised in order that sensible transformations may be performed. In many domains important information structures must be aggregated across multiple files, and numerous legacy file formats obscure the natural logical structure of information types. We present a solution for constructing semantic data services for an earth-sciences data grid (the UK NERC DataGrid). A semantically-rich data model is developed, drawing on components from external ontologies. A 'storage descriptor' provides the mechanism for mapping legacy file-based storage onto data model instances. Finally, data services may be built on top of the data model to expose a semantic view of the data irrespective of the underlying file storage details. Our approach is similar to wrapper/mediator architectures for integrating database management systems.},
